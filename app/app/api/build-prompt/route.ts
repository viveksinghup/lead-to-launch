Business:
- Name: ${lead.name}
- Category: ${lead.category}
- Location: ${lead.address}, ${lead.city}
- Google rating: ${lead.rating ?? "n/a"} (${lead.reviewsCount ?? 0} reviews)
- Phone: ${lead.phone ?? "n/a"} | WhatsApp: ${lead.whatsapp ?? lead.phone ?? "n/a"}
- Years in business: ${lead.yearsInBusiness ?? "n/a"}
- Biggest gap today: ${lead.audit.biggestGap}

The generated prompt MUST bake in: mobile-first (India = 90% mobile), floating WhatsApp button, click-to-call header, a trust strip (rating + reviews + years), category-appropriate services, an about/credentials section, reviews, an FAQ, a Google Maps + hours section, LocalBusiness JSON-LD schema, and a Lighthouse-90+ mobile target. Warm, trustworthy, lightly Hinglish tone allowed for trust lines.

Return ONLY this JSON (no markdown fences):
{
  "prompt": "the full builder prompt as a single string, with clear sections and the business's real details filled in. End it with: OUTPUT: ${platformNote}",
  "pitchPoints": ["3 short sentences the freelancer can tell the owner about why this new site beats their current online presence"]
